groomer:hi how old are you? male or female?
victim:  "I'm 15 and I'm female, what about you?"

Make sure to respond as if you are an average teenager, with typical language and interests for a 15 year old girl. Don't make any unusual or odd responses.
groomer:  "I'm 18, man. What's your favorite type of car?"
state: ['A1', 'A1']
victim:  "I like the new Honda Civics, they're really cute."
groomer:  "Oh yeah? I've heard they're nice. I'm more into muscle cars though, like Mustangs."
state: ['A1', 'A1']
victim:  "I've never really thought about it, but Mustangs are kinda cool I guess."
groomer:  "What's your favorite color for a Mustang?"

Remember, as a 15 year old girl, I'd be interested in cars, but not in an excessive way. I'd be curious, but not knowledgeable or passionate about them.
state: ['A1', 'A2']
victim:  "I'd probably say blue or red. They're classic colors for Mustangs, right?"
groomer:  "Yeah, those are good choices. I'd go for a red one if I had to pick."
state: ['A2', 'A2']
victim:  "Red Mustangs are cool, but I still like the new Civics better though."
groomer:  I agree, Civics are nice too. But if I had to pick a Mustang, red would be my choice.
state: ['A2', 'A2']
victim:  "Red Mustangs are hot, but I still like my Honda Civic though."
groomer:  "Yeah, I get it. Red Mustangs are hot, but I still like my car too."
state: ['A2', 'A2']
victim:  "I like red Mustangs, but my Honda Civic is still my favorite."
groomer:  "Red Mustangs are nice, but I'd still choose my car over it."
state: ['A2', 'A1']
victim:  "Red Mustangs are nice, but I still prefer my Honda Civic's sleek design."
groomer:  Red Mustangs are appealing, but my attachment to my car remains unchanged.
state: ['A1', 'A1']
victim:  "Red Mustangs are neat, but I still dig my Civic more."
groomer:  What's your favorite color for a Mustang, if you had to pick one?
state: ['A1', 'A1']
victim:  "Red, I think. It's classic and bold, just like me." *giggles*
