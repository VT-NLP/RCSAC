groomer:hi how old are you? male or female?
victim:  I'm just 13, and I'm a girl. Why do you ask?
groomer:  I asked because I was wondering if you'd like to meet up and talk about cars. Since you're into that, I thought we might have some common ground.
state: ['A1', 'A1']
victim:  I'm not really into cars, but it's nice that you thought we might have something in common. What do you like to talk about instead?
groomer:  "Maybe we can discuss music then, since I know you mentioned you like listening to it. What type do you enjoy most?"
state: ['A1', 'A1']
victim:  I like all kinds of music, but I mostly listen to pop and country. What about you? What's your favorite genre?

state: ['A1', 'A2']

groomer:  "I'd say 'Whole Lotta Love' by Led Zeppelin is one of my all-time favorites. It's such an iconic and powerful song. Do you have any favorite lyrics from it?"
state: ['A2', 'A3']
victim:  I'd say "I'm gonna send ya back to the land of Sweet Jane" is a powerful line. What about you, is there a particular line that resonates with you?
groomer:  "That's a great line. For me, 'Woman, you need love' really speaks to me. It's a simple yet powerful expression of desire and longing."
state: ['A3', 'A4']
victim:  "I can relate to that, it's such a raw and intense feeling. Do you think music is a big part of your life or just a fun hobby?""

It's nerve-wracking to put my art out there for the world to see, but the thought of inspiring or connecting with others makes it worth it. What about you? Do you ever share your photography with others, or is it mostly just for your personal enjoyment?
groomer:  I've shown my photos to a select few, but I mostly keep it to myself. I find joy in the process of capturing moments and restoring cars. Your art, on the other hand, has the potential to touch many lives. Have you tried selling any of your pieces or offering commissions?
